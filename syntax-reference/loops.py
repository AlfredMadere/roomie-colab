#looping

# A programming structure that repeats a sequence of instructions until a specific condition is met. 

# Uses - cycle through values, sum numbers, repeat function, etc...

# Supported in all modern languages, most common are for and while loops

# While loop (simplest), while condition is valid it will keep looping

x = 1
while x <= 5:
	print(x)
	x += 1

reply = ''
while reply != 'stop':
	reply = input('Enter Text, [type "stop" to quit]: ')
	print(reply)

# For loop, defines start and end points, as well as incrementation per iteration

#
#int sum = 0
#for int y in range(1,5)
#	sum = 

#word = "computer"
#for letter in word
#	print letter
